# Neovim Project
This project was created to initially first help me learn the vim keybinds, using an extension off godot to allow me to use vim in the integrated IDE. There are a few bugs in the extensions so the idea was ultimately scrapped.
I also need to learn how to use vim more effectively (and be able to customise my experience) before I approach this as an actual playable game.

This uses Godot 4.3.


## Future Development
- [x] Add attacks
- [ ] Usable UI with menu and game over screens
- [ ] Add enemies which trigger certain attacks
- [ ] Make everything look nicer

### Big changes that will probably not be done
